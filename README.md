## Overview

- the challenge is to use the understanding in HTML and CSS to create a preview card.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

## My process

- Step1: build a required semantic HTML
- Step2: using CSS to style each element
- Step3: DONE! ðŸ˜™

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- pure CSS (maybe will try Tailwind or Bootstrap next time!!)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that <figure> tag can be used as self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the <figcaption> element.

```html
<figure class="Head-container">
  <img src="./assets/images/illustration-article.svg" alt="illustration" />
  <figcaption class="card-tag">Learning</figcaption>
  <figcaption class="publish-date">Published 21 Dec 2023</figcaption>
</figure>
```

I learned that I can set variable to use repeatedly in many sections by using :root then add --(variable name): (CSS value)

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: rgb(245, 208, 78);
}
. . . .card-tag {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}
```
